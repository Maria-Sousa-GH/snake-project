# Great job on your game!

Even though the menu screen isn’t showing up just yet, 
you should be really proud of what you’ve accomplished here!

### What is great right now:
- **File Management**: Excellent job with the encapsulation 
of file management in the `FileManagement` class. 
This is a clean and effective way to handle data.

- **Gameplay**: The game is functioning well, and the jar file works 
without issues on my end, which is great! If anyone experiences errors, 
feel free to send them my way for further investigation.

- **Feedback Integration**: It’s clear that you’ve worked hard on integrating feedback 
and making improvements. Keep up the great work!

### What to improve:
1. **Encapsulation and Readability**: 
   - On the `checkConflict` method, consider encapsulating the conditions inside a method with a meaningful name. This would improve the readability of your code and make it more maintainable.
   - The same suggestion applies to the `foodCollision` method in the `Game` class. Having clearer, well-named methods can really enhance the overall code quality.

2. **Naming Conventions**: 
   - **Class Naming**: The class `Gamescreen` should be renamed to `GameScreen` to follow standard Java naming conventions.
   - **Method Naming**: Watch out for typos in your method names. For example, the method `speedActualiz()` should be `speedActualize()` (or better yet, `updateSpeed()` for clarity). Typos like this can lead to difficult-to-find bugs later on.

3. **Score Handling**:
   - There was an issue with the score not updating because you were updating the wrong variable. The `textSpeedInit()` and `speedActualiz()` methods were modifying `scoreText` instead of `speedText`. Make sure the correct variable is being updated!

4. **Collision Detection**: 
   - The conditions in your collision detector could also be encapsulated for better readability and maintainability. This will help keep your code clean and easier to update in the future.

5. **High Score Display**: 
   - Consider showing the high score on the screen. Displaying this above the game area will give players a goal to strive for, adding an extra layer of motivation and competition.

6. **Second Screen Issue**:
   - The issue with the second screen not displaying was related to concurrency. This is a topic we'll dive deeper into in a few weeks, but rest assured, there are ways to avoid this in the future. For now, feel free to revisit this or find alternate solutions.

### Final Thoughts:
**Excellent progress!** You’ve made significant strides in improving your game based on the feedback, and it's clear you've applied everything you've learned so far. Keep up the fantastic work, and continue pushing yourself to refine and improve your skills. You’re on the right path!
