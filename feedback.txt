Congrats on having a working MVP of the snake game! You should celebrate this moment!
In you are on the right path, and I see you took full advantage fo what you've learned
with Car Crash's implementation!

Here are things you should consider improving on this assignment:

- It's a convention and a good practice to have main packages in your `src` folder. They
should follow a rule, from the most general to the most specific part in a domain name, like
`com.codeforall.online`.

- A great deal of your classes are well encapulated and organised, but your Game class is doing
quite a lot of things. Try encapsulating it more, creating specialised classes, like one just to handle
the keyboard, and give it as property in the Game class if you need its methods. This will greatly
improve the maintainability of your code, and it will not become a nightmare as the application grows.

- Watch out for never used variables, they pollute your code, and they also present repeated code.
Take a look to your `snakeInit()` method.

- Give meaningful names to your variables it will facilitate your lives a great deal in the future.

- Watch out for extra spaces and un-indented code, they worsen readability.

- Create a way to leave the game, like a `close`. To do that take a look to `System.exit(0)`.

- Create a menu or some way to display the rules, it can be daunting for users to not know how to play
a game, even one so much intuitive as this one.

- Let the snakes pass the borders and appear on the other side. And perhaps letting the snake become faster
as they eat.

- Play around using images for the food and for the background. It will turn your game more alluring.

- Venture yourselves and do not be afraid of being more creative. This is how you learn!
